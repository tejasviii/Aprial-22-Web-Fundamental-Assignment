        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <p>The Hyper Text Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documentsdesigned to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technogies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript</p>
        <p>Web browser receives HTML documentsfrom a web server or from local storage and render the docments into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally include such cues for the appearance of the document</p>
        <p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML construct, image and object such as interactive page. HTML provides a means to create structured docments by denoting structural semantics for text such as heading, paragraphs, lists, links, quote and other items. HTML are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.</p>
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript. </p>
        <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <p>JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.</p>
        <p>JavaScript was first known as LiveScript, but Netscape changed its name to JavaScript, possibly because of the excitement being generated by Java. JavaScript made its first appearance in Netscape 2.0 in 1995 with the name LiveScript. The general-purpose core of the language has been embedded in Netscape, Internet Explorer, and other web browsers.</p>
        <p>One of major strengths of JavaScript is that it does not require expensive development tools. You can start with a simple text editor such as Notepad. Since it is an interpreted language inside the context of a web browser, you don't even need to buy a compiler.</p>
        <p>The ECMAScript Edition 5 standard will be the first update to be released in over four years. JavaScript 2.0 conforms to Edition 5 of the ECMAScript standard, and the difference between the two is extremely minor.</p>
